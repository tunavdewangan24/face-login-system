# face-login-system
A simple HTML &amp; CSS project showcasing a face-recognition-based login system UI.   
Face Login System is a secure authentication application that enables users to access a system using facial recognition technology. The system captures facial data through a webcam, compares it with stored user data, and grants access upon successful verification. This project demonstrates the use of computer vision concepts and modern authentication methods to replace traditional password-based login systems.
